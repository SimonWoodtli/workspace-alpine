## Pkgs to be installed at the first time runnning the container. They're
## being installed with just and the workspace-alpine.sh install script
## asciinema from alpine doesn't work in a container => pipx does
## TODO Install linters via asdf
## Python: pylint mypy flake8 virtualenv
## webdev: eslint prettier stylelint stylelint-config-standard
## TODO rm sdk as soon as asdf is all setup
## TODO add all other tools to asdf
## TODO test if other hugo plugin can do latest and still give extended
## FIXME if asdf is installed from within Alpine Linux, you cannot
## install nodejs cause they are compiled with glibc not musl. Gotta try
## to get this done from the host
##FIX to no get musl/glibc issue with running nodejs via asdf on Alpine
